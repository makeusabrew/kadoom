Kadoom!
=======

A top down shoot-em-up, a bit like ones you found in the old days except you get
to blow up real people, in real time, all from the comfort of your browser.

Okay, let's play!
-----------------

Great! Head on over to http://kadoom.org (well, soon anyway!)

Modify Me!
----------

Kadoom needs you! Well, sort of. It'd very much like your contributions anyway - so please feel free to fork the project to add a cool new feature / weapon.

What's in a name?
-----------------

I'm not totally sure - I started a similar project years ago in C++ and this was what I called it. I think it was a play on 'kaboom' and the legendary game [Doom](http://www.idsoftware.com/games/doom/doom-ultimate/) which I was aiming to part-recreate from a top down perspective. Either way, it stuck for this re-remake too.
